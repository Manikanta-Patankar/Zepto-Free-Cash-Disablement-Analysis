This project explores why some Zepto users lose access to "free cash" rewards using a simulated dataset of 827 users.

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Multiple Devices**: Users with 3+ linked devices had a ~70–75% disablement rate.
- **No Wallet Top-Up**: 72.6% of users who never added wallet money lost access.
- **Evening Logins**: High disablement during 6–9 PM — peak risk hours.
- **Frequent Orders**: 72.5% disablement rate for users with 7–10 orders.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Data is simulated — real data needed for validation.
- More behavioral features may improve accuracy.

## ✅ Next Steps

- Share findings with fraud/product teams.
- Use features to build a fraud detection model.
- Validate patterns with real user data.
